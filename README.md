# PassageAlarm

A simple passage detector that sends an SMS to a predefined receiver.

The hardware is based on a Arduino Leonardo (LeoFi) compatible board from Electronic SweetPeas and a Seeedstudio GPRS shield. Two invisible laser modules are used to create a beam that a visitor crosses when entering into the guarded zone.
